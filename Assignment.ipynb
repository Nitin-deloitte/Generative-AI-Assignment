      "Nutrition and Diet is a topic that focuses on the importance of eating a balanced diet and understanding the nutritional value of food. It also covers the effects of diet on health and well-being.\n",

      " This publication is owned by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. and published by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah. All rights are reserved in the United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      " This guide outlines the kinds of food that provide good nutrition according to the Word of Wisdom. It includes six food groups, six nutrients, and proper amounts of food for good health. It also discusses purifying water and food, eating disorders, obesity, malnutrition, energy needs, and the body mass index. Additional information can be found in the guide and online.\n",
      "\n",
      " Eating a balanced diet of a variety of foods from the food groups of grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, complete proteins, and vegetable oils is essential for good health. Different cultures may use different symbols to represent a balanced diet, but all emphasize variety and the right amounts of servings from each food group. Discretionary calories should be limited to avoid excessive weight gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Good nutrition includes eating grains for carbohydrates and fiber, brightly colored vegetables and fruits for vitamins, minerals, and fiber, dairy for calcium and protein, meats, legumes, and nuts for proteins, and fats (oils) for essential fatty acids. Iodized salt should be used to avoid goiters. Proteins are the \"building blocks of life\" and are made of chains of up to 20 different amino acids. Complete proteins include meats and animal products, while partially complete proteins can be made complete by combining with another protein source. Breast milk is an ideal source of protein for babies up to 24 months.\n",
      "\n",
      " Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, and are the main source of energy for the body. Monosaccharides are the basic dietary carbohydrate and include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Disaccharides are formed when two monosaccharides join together, and starches are long chains of glucose. Cellulose is also a long chain of glucose and is a type of indigestible fiber. Carbohydrates provide energy for the brain, muscles, and other body functions, and combine with proteins or fats to form important parts of the body. Carbohydrates are digested in the intestine and absorbed into the liver, where they are used for circulation or storage. Eating or drinking certain carbohydrates can increase the risk of diabetes mellitus if one is at risk. Lactose intolerance is caused by a lack of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose into its two parts.\n",
      "\n",
      " Fats are mostly made of carbon and hydrogen and are divided into three categories: saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. Saturated fats are solid and promote high blood cholesterol, while monounsaturated fats are a healthy form of concentrated energy. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential to good health and can be found in vegetable oils, fish oil, and certain other oils. Trans fatty acids are formed when hydrogen is added to unsaturated fats to make them solid. Fats are important for cell membranes, insulation, and energy storage. Cholesterol is another type of fat found in all cell membranes and performs several functions, but excess cholesterol, saturated fats, and trans fats in the diet can increase bad cholesterol in blood and worsen atherosclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      " Macrominerals and microminerals are essential for life and health. Macrominerals, such as electrolytes, are required in large amounts in the diet, while microminerals, such as iron, are required in very small amounts. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body and is important for muscle tone, muscle contraction, and nervous system functions. Phosphorus combines with calcium to strengthen the skeleton and participates in numerous chemical reactions in the body. Magnesium is important for normal muscle and nerve functions, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Iron is a micromineral that makes up a central part of hemoglobin in red blood cells and carries life-giving oxygen throughout the body. Good sources of macrominerals and microminerals include fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, and fortified cereals. If deficiencies occur, supplements may be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      " Iodine and zinc are essential minerals for human health and function. Iodine deficiency can lead to goiters, loss of energy, mental function slowing down, and cretinism. Zinc deficiency can lead to skin rashes, dermatitis, hair loss, diarrhea, poor wound healing, and decreased immune function. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) can be stored in the body and can be toxic if consumed in large amounts. Water-soluble vitamins (B, C, and choline) must be replaced frequently and do not generally reach toxic levels. Sources of these vitamins include seafood, dairy products, beans, nuts, and fortified cereals.\n",
      "\n",
      " There are seven water-soluble vitamins: B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), B12 (cobalamin), niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, folic acid, and vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Each vitamin has its own sources and deficiency symptoms, ranging from anemia and depression to dermatitis and psychosis. Choline is a recently recognized essential nutrient, found in egg yolk and lecithin, and its deficiency can cause fatty liver and liver damage.\n",
      "\n",
      " The human body needs an average of 2-2.5 liters of water per day, which can be replaced by food and beverages. Caffeine and guarana found in some drinks can increase water loss and increase fluid needs. Dehydration can cause significant problems, including reduced physical and mental function, headache, dry eyes, irritability, and sleepiness. For infants, mother's milk is the best food for the first 4-6 months, and other nutrients are needed after that. Iron-fortified baby cereal, pureed fruits, vegetables, and meats can be introduced one at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article provides information on how to feed an infant if the mother's milk is not available, such as in an emergency. It also discusses dietary supplements, such as vitamin D, folic acid, and vitamin C, which may be necessary in certain circumstances. It is important to note that excess amounts of some supplements may create an unhealthy balance of nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      " Vegetarian diets can vary in the amount of animal products consumed, with vegans consuming none. Macronutrients such as carbohydrates and fats are plentiful, but complete proteins may require the consumption of soy protein, legumes, nuts, grains, and vegetables. Intake of several minerals and vitamins may be limited, and water purification is recommended if the water supply is not known to be safe.\n",
      "\n",
      " Clarified water must be disinfected by boiling for 3-5 minutes or adding 2-4 drops of chlorine bleach to 1 liter or quart and letting it stand for 30 minutes. Commercial water filters can also be used. Eating contaminated food is a common source of illness, so it is best to cook, peel, boil, or forget it. All surfaces that come into contact with food should be cleaned with warm, soapy water or sanitizing solution and rinsed with purified water. Prepared food should be eaten or put into a refrigerator within two hours, and cleaned out of the refrigerator and discarded at least weekly.\n",
      "\n",
      " Eating disorders are serious eating behaviors that can be fatal if left untreated. They include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating. Women are more likely than men to have eating disorders and they usually start in the teenage years. Treatment involves monitoring, mental health therapy, nutritional counseling, and sometimes medicines. Obesity is caused by eating more calories than used for activity and maintenance and can lead to type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. It is best to begin early to control a tendency to be overweight and morbid obesity may require weight loss surgery if life is in jeopardy.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article provides advice on how to manage weight, including exercising for at least 30 minutes a day, eating a carefully selected diet low in animal fat, and taking a daily multiple vitamin and mineral supplement. It also provides advice on how to design a weight-reduction diet, and how to manage malnutrition, which is a risk when body mass index is less than 18. It is important to treat underlying infections and physical and emotional diseases while attempting to restore a normal body weight, and to feed a malnourished person under the direction of a competent health care professional.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a calculation of weight and height used to measure fat levels. The range for good health is 18.5-25, and obesity is 30-40. Daily calorie needs are estimated based on gender, age, and activity, and can be used to lose or gain weight. A balanced diet includes servings from each food group, and the size of each serving is important to determine the total number of calories consumed.\n",
      "\n",
      " This article provides a table of suggested servings for different total daily calories, ranging from 1000 to 3200. It also provides additional resources for further information on food portion control and food composition.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"16\" is a number that is equal to the sum of its divisors (1 + 2 + 4 + 8). It is also a perfect square and is the fourth power of two.\n",
      "\n",
      " The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of the appropriateness of a person's weight for their height. It is calculated using either weight in kg and height in meters, or weight in lbs and height in inches. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25, although for persons over 50 years, up to 28 is acceptable. If the BMI is less than 17.5, then the person is severely underweight and may have protein-energy malnutrition. A computation chart is provided to help calculate the BMI.\n",
      "\n",
      " This passage provides an equation and table to help determine an individual's estimated daily calorie requirement. Factors to consider include gender, weight, height, level of activity, and age. The equation and coefficients are adapted from the Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (Macronutrients). The activity factor table provides the activity level for boys, girls, men, and women.\n",
      "\n",
      " This is a set of instructions for calculating the estimated energy requirement for men, women, boys, and girls. It involves entering target weight, height, and age into the instructions, multiplying the numbers, and subtracting the product of age from the sum of the other products to get the estimated daily maintenance calories.\n",

These foods contain six kinds of nutrients: proteins (2) , carbohydrates (3) , fats  (4), \\nminerals  (5), vitamins (6) , and water (8) . A person should regularly eat or drink enough of all \\nof these nutrients to grow and remain healthy. For infant nutrition (8) , mother’s milk itself \\nprovides an ideal balance of nutrients, with the gradual introduction of solid foods after four to six months of age. \\nIf a variety from all food groups is eaten regularly, it is not usually necessary to take \\nsupplements (9)\\n. Even carefully chosen vegetarian (10)  diets that include dairy products or \\neggs can be quite sufficient. But if little or no animal products are eaten, then grains must be eaten with legumes (beans, peas, peanuts, and lentils), nuts, and seeds to provide \\nbalanced protein.  \\nFood and drink must also be clean and free from disease-causing germs (bacteria, viruses, \\nand parasites) to be healthy. Purified water (10)\\n (potable water) is prepared by removing dirt \\nfrom the water and treating the water to remove or kill germs. In some areas, the \\ngovernment purifies water that is delivered through secured plumbing; this water is safe to \\nuse directly from the faucet for food and drink. In most of the world, however, water should be purified before use. Foods (11)\\n should be washed free of dirt and then peeled, cooked, \\nboiled, or sanitized before eating. \\nFood must be eaten in proper amounts (14, 15)  to maintain good health. \\nEating  disorders (12) are serious, negative eating behaviors that can be fatal if untreated. \\nGenerally, obesity (12)  results from eating more while malnutrition (13)  results from eating \\nless food than needed for growth, maintenance, and daily activity. \\nDaily  energy needs  (14,  18) can be estimated based on age, height, weight, and level of \\nactivity. The body mass index (14, 17)  (BMI) can be a useful measure of the degree of \\nunder-nutrition or over-nutrition. \\nMore details about each of the underlined topics can be found in this guide on the pages \\nshown in parentheses.

The preferred \\nsubstitute is an iron-fortified commercial infant \\nformula prepared exactly as instructed on the \\nlabel.  Caution:  Do not dilute with extra water . \\n In an emergency, when neither mother’s milk nor \\ncommercial formula is available, a temporary \\nsubstitute can be prepared by mixing 19 fl. oz. \\n(600 mL) whole cow milk, 13 fl. oz. (400 mL) \\nwater, and 3 tablespoons (45 mL) granulated \\nsugar [or alternatively 10 fl. oz. (300 mL) \\nevaporated milk, 22 fl. oz. (700 mL) water, and 3 \\ntablespoons (45 mL) granulated sugar]. Bring just \\nto a boil and let it cool to room temperature in a \\nsterile container protected from dust and flies. \\nCaution:  Condensed milk, honey, molasses, and \\ncorn syrup sweetener should not be used, and \\ngoat milk requires a folic acid supplement.  \\n \\nAdditional resource: \\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics; infant nutrition  \\n \\nDietary Supplements \\n Supplements to a well-balanced diet are \\ngenerally not necessary. \\n Excess amounts of some supplements may \\ncreate an unhealthy balance of nutrients.   \\n However, modest specialized supplements \\nare desirable in special circumstances. \\n Vitamin D production by exposure of the skin to \\nthe sun is usually adequate. \\n Skin synthesis of vitamin D may not be \\nadequate: \\n\\uf0a7 With decreased sun exposure beyond \\n40° latitude.   \\n\\uf0a7 When the skin is covered with \\nsunscreen or clothing or as skin \\npigmentation increases. \\n\\uf0a7 In the elderly, who often do not produce \\nenough 7-dehydrocholesterol, which is \\nnecessary for vitamin D production. \\n Since human milk levels of vitamin D are \\nvery low, if nursing infants are not exposed \\nto sunlight, they may be at risk for \\ndeveloping crooked bones and fractures \\n(rickets). However, too much sun exposure \\nincreases the risk of dehydration, sunburn, \\nand eventually skin cancer in later life.   \\n In all such circumstances, a vitamin D \\nsupplement may be helpful. \\n Women are particularly susceptible to \\ndeveloping osteoporosis and bone fractures \\nlater in life \\n They should consume adequate calcium, \\nvitamin D, and vitamin K to: \\n\\uf0a7 Maximize bone mineral deposits during \\nthe growth and childbearing years. \\n\\uf0a7 Maintain bone mineral content \\nthereafter. \\n If sufficient amounts are not eaten, then \\nsupplements containing them would be \\nprudent. \\n Folic acid \\n Birth defects increase if folic acid is low. \\n A folic acid supplement is advisable before \\nand during pregnancy. \\n If not available, a special effort to eat a diet \\nrich in folic acid would be wise (e.g., \\nfortified foods such as grains and cereals, \\nliver, cowpeas, great northern beans, \\nbaked beans, spinach, broccoli, asparagus, \\nand green peas). \\n Vitamin C \\n Fresh fruits and vegetables may be hard to \\nfind in very cold climates for months at a \\ntime. \\n In such cases, a vitamin C supplement \\nwould be helpful. \\n Since absorption of B vitamins decreases with \\nage, the elderly may benefit from a supplement. \\n Vitamin B 12 is not present in plants. Those \\neating a strict vegetarian diet may need to \\nreceive a supplement.   \\n Supplements are also useful for treating \\nspecifically identified deficiencies.   \\n For example, iron deficiency anemia may \\nbe treated with an iron supplement .   \\n On the other hand, if large doses of zinc, \\ncopper, or other nutrients are taken without \\nthere being a deficiency, they may interfere \\nwith the absorption and utilization of critical \\nnutrients such as iron. \\nAdditional resource: \\nOffice of Dietary Supplements, NIH; fact sheets on \\ndifferent supplements', metadata={'source': '/home/nitin2/Downloads/nutrition-and-diet.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",
